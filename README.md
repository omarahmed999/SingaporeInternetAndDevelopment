# Singapore Internet And Development
As a part of my learning journey I used Singapore as a case study to apply EDA and see the relation between how internet affects and shapes nations and if there is a relationship between internet and country development.
I used the world bank api (wbgapi) as my main source of data
Indicators included:
- GDP growth (annual %)
- GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)
- Foreign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)
- Life expectancy at birth, total (years)
- Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1,000 live births)
- Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)
- High-technology exports (% of manufactured exports)
- Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
- Mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people)

After cleaning:
- Dropped columns with very low data coverage
- Converted Year to integer and other columns to float
